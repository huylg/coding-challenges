Create docs folder and put md files into it without @client/README.md

**Cursor**

Moved all Markdown files into the new `docs/` folder while leaving `client/README.md` in place. The original Markdown files were removed from their previous locations and re-created under `docs/` with the same relative structure to avoid name collisions (for example, `docs/server/README.md`, `docs/.cursor/plans/...`).

If you want me to update any links or references that still point to the old locations, say the word and I’ll handle it.
